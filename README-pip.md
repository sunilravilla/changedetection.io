_Need an actual Chrome runner with Javascript support? We support fetching via WebDriver and Playwright!</a>_

#### Key Features

- Lots of trigger filters, such as "Trigger on text", "Remove text by selector", "Ignore text", "Extract text", also using regular-expressions!
- Target elements with xPath and CSS Selectors, Easily monitor complex JSON with JSONPath or jq
- Switch between fast non-JS and Chrome JS based "fetchers"
- Easily specify how often a site should be checked
- Execute JS before extracting text (Good for logging in, see examples in the UI!)
- Override Request Headers, Specify `POST` or `GET` and other methods
- Use the "Visual Selector" to help target specific elements


```bash
$ pip3 install changedetection.io
```

Specify a target for the *datastore path* with `-d` (required) and a *listening port* with `-p` (defaults to `5000`)

```bash
$ changedetection.io -d /path/to/empty/data/dir -p 5000
```


Then visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 , You should now be able to access the UI.
